Sydav Studios was founded in 2026 by Sydney Davidson as a way to pay workers a fair wage based upon their work rather than an arbitrary number set years ago.

We make the dream games of our workers, and the person who has the idea gets to head the project and designate people however they please.

Our first game, Project Remembrance, started pre-production on Feb 18th, 2026, which we consider the day the company was TRULY founded.

We are a Queer run company headed by a Bisexual Trans Woman.

As of right now, our team consists of three people who are working on Project: Remembrance:

Sydney Davidson (Founder, Coder)

RadTaiga (Artist, Visual Design)

Alexandra (Musician, Sound Design)
